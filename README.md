# Golang Practice For 6.824-Distributed System.

#### author: Lewis


This project is managed by a efficient git model shown in [here](https://www.oschina.net/translate/a-successful-git-branching-model). I wish I can learn about golang, distributed system as well as the usage of git. To be standard, I will divide the whole project into some stage according to the lecture. For each lecture, I will assign a version number attaching some new feature. After finishing a new feature, i will merge it into branch 'develop'. The master is used to tagging. The version history is list below. 

At the same time, i will record the whole process of this project in my [blog](http://flame4.github.io).
